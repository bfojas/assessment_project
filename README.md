## Assesment Project

### Purpose

React-Native app for making and viewing reservations using the given GraphQL backend endpoint.

### What's it Doing?

It wasn't required to do a login, but I wanted to just have something simple for the app to recognize the user, so I threw a input into the home screen. Once you pass the home screen, there are only two views, one for making reservations and one for viewing.

Making reservations is comprised of the user name coming from context, a random ID number generated by the component, a hotel name coming from the HotelInput component, and check-in/check-out dates coming from the DateInput component. There's a button that is disabled until all fields are complete. The button runs the GraphQL createReservation mutation. I didn't have a list of hotels to work with, so I just populated the dropdown list for it with generic names.

![Date Select](https://dev-fun-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/dateSelect.png "Date Select")

Viewing reservations is pretty straight forward. It's just a list of reservations (based on the user name) in date ascending order coming from a GraphQL query. Each entry in the list has the hotel name, check-in date, check-out date, and a generic picture.

### Process

#### Creating It

Created with the React-Native CLI using react-native init.

Installed the following modules:

* "apollo-boost": "^0.1.27"
* "graphql": "^14.3.1"
* "graphql-tag": "^2.10.1"
* "react-native-datepicker": "^1.7.2"
* "react-native-linear-gradient": "^2.5.4"

#### Working on It

As a junior developer, I wasn't 100% familiar with all the technologies that I was being asked to use, but felt confident that I would be able to learn about them and put them all together. This was pretty fun. Learning can be a frustrating process at times, but the sense of reward from figuring things out always makes it worth it.

##### TypeScript
I've never used TypeScript before, but was actually quite excited about it's implementation. It definitely forced me to think my code through more clearly.

##### GraphQL
I've sat through a GraphQL lecture before, but never used this either. Learning to understand the workings of this compared to REST APIs was neat. The GraphiQL interface was a lot more pleasant that normal API documentation once I got a handle of what was going on.

A lot of the lessons that I saw had the queries and mutations inside the components that were using them, but I thought it made the components look too verbose, so I put them into a seperate file and imported them in. Not sure if this is the best practice way to do it, but would love to see how companies normally implement it.

##### Jest/Enzyme
I've used Jest before on Node backends, but had to get familiar with it on React Apps. Seemed pretty straight forward once the proper dependencies and Enzyme were set up. I only put 1 test suite in. Because of the simplicity of the app, I wasn't really sure what else I could test. Definitely need to look more into React testing. I had hooks in the MakeReservation component, but had to replace it with a class component for the sake of simplifying the tests.

##### Context
Normally I use Redux to pass global state around, but the instructions wanted something else, so I had to learn how to use React Context API. The only thing I had in the global state was the username, so I probably could have done it all with just prop-drilling (especially since the component tree isn't too deep), but it actually helped simplify the navigation.

##### React-Native
I've been dabbling in React-Native in the short time since finishing my coding bootcamp, but it's been relatively basic. I know this app isn't super advanced, by any means, but it went beyond what I have previously done with it. I was glad that this project had me digging deeper into the rabbit hole.


### Conclusion
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
